Try it, you’ll strike it.
Bowling is fun in your spare time.
Bowling is right up my alley.
Bowlers always have time to spare.
Bowlers do it in alleys.
12 strikes and you’re perfect.
Bowlers never die, they just end up in the gutter.
Bowlers: Keep your minds out of the Gutter.
Bowling:  An alley you can play in.
Bowling- You can get 3 strikes, and you’re not out.
If you don’t get a strike – spare Me!
It’s not how you bowl, its how you roll.
Its about playing catch & throwing strikes.
Keep your balls out of the gutter!
Knocking them down, one pin at a time.
Leave no Pin Standing.
Let the pins fall where they may.
Let’s knock em down.
Make your competitive juices overcome your excuses.
My bowling team rocks!
Never a good time to clean the gutters.
No Smoking – Just a Lucky Strike!
No splits too wide if you got the balls.
Teamwork makes the dream work.
What happens at the bowling alley, stays at the bowling alley.
